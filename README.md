# pb - Pocket Computer Simulator

## Introduction

_pb_ is a simulation of the Casio PB-100 pocket computer. It consists of a
BASIC interpreter and a simulated pocket computer environment.

Note that this technically isn't a PB-100 emulator since it is only an
implementation of a compatible BASIC interpreter. A full emulation would
recreate the Hitachi HD61913 microprocessor in software, using the system
software of the original PB-100. If anyone has these technical details, please
get in touch.
